nss (3.12.0~1.9b1-2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * debian/control: libnss3-1-dbg needs to conflict with older libnss3-0d-dbg,
    as it overwrites so of its files. Closes: #455875.
  * debian/patches/90_realpath.dpatch: Use realpath() in
    loader_GetOriginalPathname, so that symlinks are properly followed when
    determining where the current library lives.
  * debian/patches/00list: Updated accordingly.
  * debian/patches/85_security_load.dpatch: When the module given by the
    caller contains a directory name, remove it so that the module can be
    properly loaded. Closes: #456296.

nss (3.12.0~1.9b1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot, picked from FIREFOX_3_0b1_RELEASE cvs tag.
  * debian/copyright: Add licensing information about the recently added
    sqlite copy in the source tree.
  * debian/control:
    + Build depend on libsqlite3-dev.
    + Rename all -0d packages to -1d, but keep a transitional -0d package,
      since all libraries are compatible (except for the removed one).
    + Make libnss3-1d conflict with older libnss3-0d.
  * debian/patches/38_kbsd.dpatch, debian/patches/81_sonames.dpatch:
    Adapted to upstream changes.
  * debian/patches/81_sonames.dpatch:
    + Remove SO version from libsoftokn3, now it is not linked against
      anymore, but dlloaded.
    + Remove the hacks to have shlibsign and the signature verification code
      handle the SO version in the file name.
    + Bump SO version to 1d.
  * debian/rules:
    + Add NSS_USE_SYSTEM_SQLITE=1 to the make options.
    + Install libsoftokn3 and the new libnssdbm3 in /usr/lib/nss.
    + Run shlibsign on libsoftokn3 in /usr/lib/nss, without a SO version.
    + For some reason, build-stamp was missing in install-stamp dependencies.
    + Bumped shlibs because of new symbols, and pass -c4 to dpkg-gensymbols,
      so that it fails in all cases where the symbols file is not up to date.
    + Adapt upstream version pattern matching so that the ~1.9b1 part is
      removed.
    + Install .1d libraries in -1d packages.
    + Create a dummy libsoftokn3.so.0d library, installed in the libnss3-0d
      package.
  * debian/libnss3-0d.links:
    + Remove links in /usr/lib/xulrunner. The workaround they were
      implementing is going to be done another way.
    + Add .0d links to .1d libraries.
  * debian/libnss3-dev.links:
    + Don't put a symlink for libsoftokn3.
    + .so files now link to .1d libraries.
  * debian/patches/80_security_build.dpatch: Remove the hack to load libfreebl
    from /usr/lib/nss.
  * debian/patches/85_security_load.dpatch: Load modules from $ORIGIN/nss.
  * debian/patches/10_3.11.7_symbol_fix.dpatch: Fix a symbol version. Stolen
    from bz#325672.
  * debian/patches/00list: Updated accordingly.
  * debian/libnss3-0d.dirs: Renamed to libnss3-1d.dirs.
